# climtools

Tools for working with climate data in python, with particular relevance to ecosystem and earth system research

## Installation

You can install `climtools` using `pip`, but its not at PyPI yet. Either clone this repository to your local environment and install with:

    pip install path/to/climtools/

or install direct from GitHub:

    pip install git+https://github.com/gremau/climtools@main

Note that there is also a `dev` branch, which might be working great or broken. Ask me if you want to know the status.
